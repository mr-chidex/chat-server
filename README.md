# Chat Server

===================
TASK
=================
Build a group based chat system that allows registered users to send and recieve real time messages. Here are the key features of the chat system:

1. User can register
2. User can see a list of all registered users
3. User can log in
4. User can log out
5. User can see all sent messages by other users if he is logged in
6. User can send a message and all other users must see that message in real time. For example, say User A sends a message, User B and C must get the message in real time assuming that only User A, B and C are all registered and logged in.
